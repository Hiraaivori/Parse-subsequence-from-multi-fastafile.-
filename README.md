# Parse-subsequence-from-multi-fastafile.-
In code1.py file there is Extraction of Subsequence from multi-fasta file(influenza.fna). Created a BED file with 3 scaffolds.
in code2.py file there is reverse_complement of those extracted seqences and right after that the changes in 1 nucleotide in each extracted sequece are then append to the original fasta file(influenza.fna.1).
